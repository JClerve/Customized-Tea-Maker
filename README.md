# Customized Tea Maker Project

## Overview
The customized tea maker is an innovative device designed to enhance the tea brewing experience. By combining mechanical structures and electronic control, this system automates the tea-making process, allowing users to customize their tea preferences. Whether you're a tea enthusiast or simply looking for a fun project, this DIY tea maker is worth exploring.

## Features
1. **Customization**: The microcontroller enables users to tailor their tea according to personal preferences. With a fully automated process, there's no need to wait in queues.
2. **Heating System**: The tea maker heats water to the optimal temperature. When an order is selected, a temperature sensor ensures the water reaches the desired level.
3. **Flask System**: Prevents heat loss during the brewing process.
4. **Automatic Cup Releasing**: An IR sensor detects cup placement. If a cup is not properly positioned, the Bluetooth module signals the automated cup-releasing system to release the necessary cups.
5. **Tea Separation Mechanism**:
   - Step 1: Initial condition with closed separation blades.
   - Step 2: Upper blade opens, allowing tea/coffee/sugar powder to fall into the space between blades.
   - Step 3: Separates 1 teaspoon of powder.
   - Step 4: Lower blade opens, depositing 1 teaspoon of powder into the cup.
   - Repeat steps based on user beverage selection.
6. **Measuring System**: Servo-controlled separation blades ensure precise measurements.
7. **Filter System**: After hot water passes through the tea leaf filter, waste leaves are disposed of in a collection bin.
8. **Sensors**:
   - **IR Sensor**: Detects cup placement.
   - **Ultrasonic Sensor**: Measures water level and ensures accurate tea pouring.
   - **Temperature Sensor**: Regulates water heating.
   - **Weight Sensor**: Calculates container weights and monitors tea wastage.
   - **Real-Time Clock (RTC) Module**: Manages timing and process duration.
   - **GSM Module**: Sends tea count and refill alerts to the counter.
   - **Bluetooth Module**: Communicates cup placement status to the cup releaser.

## Installation
